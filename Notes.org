My understanding is that nowadays makeinfo (aka texi2any) reads and
parses the input file(s) into trees, possibly transforms those trees in
various ways, and then outputs the requested format(s). Thus, line 1120
of texi2any.pl is:
  my $tree = $parser->parse_texi_file($input_file_name);
Bunches of possible $tree transformations follow, then at line 1276:
  $converter->output($tree);

This applies for html, info, etc., but PDF or DVI. Those are handled
completely differently, by exec-ing texi2dvi at the end of
texi2any.pl. And texi2dvi is just a shell wrapper around [pdf]TeX (to
rerun enough times to resolve cross-references plus endless
configuration hassles, basically).
